# LifeTracker

## Overview
LifeTracker aims to become a multifaceted personal data tracking application,
for those who want to track all of the important things in their life. Examples
include: food, happiness, fitness and finances.

Features will be added progressively over time, where the target MVP for the
first release (`v0.1.0`) is an API with happiness tracking capabilities.

## Technology Stack
The web-based API makes use of the [Spring Boot](http://spring.io/) framework.
At present, testing is taking place to choose between MariaDB and PostgreSQL
for data storage.
